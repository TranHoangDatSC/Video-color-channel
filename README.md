🎥 Video Channel Splitter with 🖼️ Icon Overlay
📌 Introduction
This script reads a video file (input.mkv), overlays an icon (icon.png) on each frame, and displays them side by side:

🖼️ Original video (with icon overlay)
🔴 Red channel
🟢 Green channel
🔵 Blue channel

Use cases:
+ Practice with image/video processing using OpenCV.
+ Demonstrate how to split color channels.
+ Show how to overlay a small image on a video.

⚙️ Technologies Used
+ OpenCV (cv2) → video I/O, resize, channel splitting.
+ Matplotlib → real-time frame visualization.
+ NumPy → pixel matrix operations.
+ Pathlib → clean, cross-platform path handling.

🚀 How to Run
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
python main.py
